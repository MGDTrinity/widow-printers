        "content": "This digital showcase, featuring items held in the Wren Library collections, is designed to accompany the Library's Summer 2024 exhibition on early modern horticulture. During the Tudor period (1485-1603), increasing travel to the likes of France, Italy and the Netherlands brought new specimens, new styles, and new ideas back to English shores. Gardening became an 'art', which could bring one closer to God, the very first gardener. This notion of gardening as a means of pursuing both spiritual and pecuniary wealth led to a surge in the publication of books on horticulture during the Elizabethan period (1558-1603) which continued well into the 17th century. Besides showcasing the impressive capabilities of contemporary printing houses, the array of books on display here demonstrates that gardens formed vital centres of socio-economic life in Renaissance England, functioning as sites of storytelling and scandal, politics and poetry, profits and pleasures.<p>[##]</p>",
