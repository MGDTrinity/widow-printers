        "content": "Curated by Madeline Birnbaum, Trinity College Library Graduate Trainee 2022-3, the Women Printers exhibition was on display in the Wren Library from July to December 2023. This exhibition highlights a selection of books held by Trinity that were produced by widows working in the book trade, primarily as printers, in the sixteenth century. When considering women in the early modern book trade, widows are a particularly important category because they acted as owners and managers of printing houses in a manner that single or married women generally could not. In this display, books printed in Antwerp, Kraków, Frankfurt, and Paris are featured, and each provides a window into the life of the woman who helped to create it. It was not uncommon for the wife of a printer to assume control of her husband’s business following his death, and while becoming widowed was often a period of instability and vulnerability, it could also be one of opportunity. The books in this display reveal the varying ways in which women responded to this change and carried on their families’ trade.<p>[##]</p>",
